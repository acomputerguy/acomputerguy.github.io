			<p class="subtopic">Imgur Posts<p>
			<p>A popular file sharing site known as Imgur is a place where people post dumps of images and short animations.
			Sometimes these dumps consist of files people wish to store locally.
			Users view this site from their phone, laptop, or desktop for posts.
			The most common collections of these medias are usually:
			<ul>
				<li>A pile of memes</li>
				<li>Reaction/Story Gifs</li>
				<li>Wallpaper/Backgrounds</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>Imgur has a <a href="https://help.imgur.com/hc/en-us/articles/201738607-Image-downloads">feature</a>
			to assist you in downloading files from a post - by zipping up all the files in an email and sends it to you.
			But there is a limitation - the "album download feature does not work for very large albums of 1,000 or more."
			Furthermore, the feature currently doesn't work.
			</p>

			<p>This is where my script comes in! <b>Note:</b> 
			Script is <mark class="successColor">successful</mark> on a post with 12,000+ files.
			Time taken for a post with 2,000 images: ~5 minutes</p>
			
			<p class="subtopic">Approach to scraping</p>
			<p>In the beginning, I thought it was as simple as finding the URLs for the files 
			listed on web page. I would look for <code>&lt;a href="//i.imgur.com/ABCDEFGH.jpg" class="zoom"></code>
			and my goal was to parse through all instances of these lines and grab the text in between the quotes.
			Then finally download the images. For example, if you open an image in a new tab you can find the URL
			in the web page. I thought you only	had to scrape for the URL of all those files.
			Bzzzt! Try again.</p>

			<p>A post with more than 10 files breaks this pattern. I won't be able to easily find 
			strings that have <code>src="//i.imgur.com/</code> for the 11th or higher media 
			listed. Looking around the web page for a 11th (or greater) one by the name
			of a123CDe.jpg (or other alternations) was interesting - it isn't in the HTML file of the post. 
			In fact - when I download the webpage, the URLs for the file did not show!</p>
			
			<p>Oddly enough, if you inspect the source code of the web page as you scroll down, then you'll notice
			there are new (about 3-8) images that show up in the <code>data-reactroot</code> div tag.
			The value of <code>&lt;div #id=&quot;</code> constantly changes to loading the next image. 
			This is how imgur loads their images.</p>

				<source src="../../assets/media/imagesChanging.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			</video>

			<p>As I scroll down, newer images appear and older images disappear. This is because of
			PHP storing images in the buffer - it can't hold them all but it can hold some temporarily.
			Just like Google Maps, when you view another location after awhile the previous area you 
			were looking at is no longer in the buffer. If you go to the Network tab and select "Img"
			(using Chrome) and scroll down the web page with a filter, ".jpg" applied, you'll see 
			images being populated as shown below. To store files in a hash to avoid duplicates while
			imitating scrolling behavior seemed to involve too much work. There has to be a simpler 
			way with the answers in specifically the HTML pages.</p>
			
			<video width="800" height="368" autoplay loop="true">
				<source src="../../assets/media/chromeConsole_imgur.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			</video>
			
			<p>After some snooping around some pages, I discovered the answer isn't in the
			gallery. By looking at the gallery HTML page where it says "Load X more images,"
			there is a reference to an album. The first 10 and remaining pictures are not shown in the
			gallery - it's in the <b>album</b>.</p>

			<p>Inspecting the source code here was another story. I knew all the images I needed were in here, but where?
			I Ctrl+F'd the page for a123CDe.jpg and nothing turned up. Then I searched for a123CDe and it shows up twice.</p>

			<p>While I was parsing through and printing results for the site, I came accross a neat message from Imgur.
			I opened console in the web browser to see the proper format and it looks like so:
			</p>

			<p>Show code running</p>
			
			<p class="subtopic">Is this Allowed?</p>
			<p>Way before I started writing the web scraper, it was my responsibility to read 
			into the site's terms of service and verify this is allowed on their website. Their 
			<a href="https://imgur.com/tos">ToS</a> allows me to use a web crawler on their site. 
			Under USE OF IMGUR CONTENT, viewers are permitted to "use UGC for personal, 
			non-commercial purposes." As a result, I claim no rights whatsoever to all the 
			user-generated content downloaded from the site.
			</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src="../../assets/images/imgur_ToS.png" alt="terms of service">
			</figure>
			
			<p>
			If you want to look further web scrapers that behave follow the rules laid out in the robots.txt file.
			At <a href="imgur.com/robots.txt">imgur.com/robots.txt</a> you can view what they do not want 
			you to scrape for. The robots exclusion standard tells you what to not process.
			I used /gallery/ and /a/ (albums) and they are not disallowed.
			This file is the equivalent to a post sign saying "Please do not go to these areas" when you enter a
			someone's territory.
			</p>

			</figure>
			
			<p>tldr; <b>Yes</b>, this script is allowed as long as you claim zero rights to what you download.</p>

			<p>Some sites reject my GET request from my code so you have to change the user agent. 
			For example, wGET's user agent is literally wGET, not the whole string that comes
			with a web browser and it's name. Imgur is nice becaue they permit the user agent for
			<code>wGET</code> and <code>Invoke-WebRequest</code>.
