			<p>What's a solid example for a real-word situation where Nmap script is required?
			A <b>perpetual scan</b>. This is usually done with a core server to carry out all the scans on the network for audits.</p>
			
			<p>Testing environment:
				</p><ul>
					<li>Kali Linux v2.0.0 virtual machine</li>
					<li>Full-duplex network connections</li>
					<li>Bash v4.3.30</li>
				</ul>
			<p></p>

			<p>Traditionally, Nmap is used as an offensive tool but the network mapper can also be used as a defensive tool. 
			You can constantly scan your local subnet for any unexpected open ports. The code uses <i>Nmap</i> and <i>Ndiff</i> to 
			constantly scan the machine it's running on and reveal any recent activity in ports on the spot.</p>

			<p>I am the back-end guy for a blue/red/white team class. 
			For fun, I figured I'd go the extra mile and write an
			<a href="https://github.com/acomputerguy/Side-Projects/blob/master/Red-Blue-Team/perpetualScan.sh">active scanning script</a> 
			in bash for the blue and red teams.</p>
			
			<p>When writing this, I thought about how <b>time</b> is a crucial factor to take into account. Here I have laid out a specific scenario:</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src="../../assets/images/2_funwithnmap/nmap_visioExample.png" alt="nmap visio example.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>What if you're sequentially scanning a large subnet and the time the scan takes to go from the first host to the second to 
			last host is enough time for an attacker to get into the <i>last box</i>, use a service, then terminate the process, and close the port?</p>
			
			<p>Nmaps' 'T' argument allows for concurrent packet requests. By running the scans on multiple boxes in parallel, this solves the issue of 
			an attacker taking advantage of time from scans going through one machine at a time.</p>
			
			<p>The Nmap arguments used are for a service scan, printing out to an xml file, and supercharged for high speed packets<a href="https://www.professormesser.com/nmap/how-to-supercharge-your-nmap-scans/4/"><sup>1</sup></a>. 
			The tradeoff is you know exactly when a port opened at the cost of a packet storm.</p>
			
			<p>
			Some features the respective teams should add:
			</p>
			<p><p style = "display:inline;color:blue">Blue</p> team: implement a form of reactive security (i.e. close port when opened)</p>
			<p><p style ="display:inline;color:red">Red</p> team: look into spoofing the IP &amp; MAC address with various addresses from multiple packets</p>
			</p>
			
			<p>Flags I hope the red team do/don't use:
			</p><ul>
				<li>(-sT) Not to use TCP connect scans - will leave audible trail in logs</li>
				<li>(-sP) Not to do a ping sweep - way too many ICMP echo requests at once, obvious it's a new conversation each time</li>
				<li>(-sR) Not to do an RPC scan - it will "grind" out many packets since it opens lots of application sessions via RPC</li>
				<li>(-n) Reverse DNS is turned on by default - will add to hosts file, port 53 will snitch on you</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Start by running the script in the background</p>

			<p>The changes are reflected as results are parsed through to store the essentials in a log file.</p>

			<p><a href="https://nmap.org/book/man-performance.html">Nmap official documentation</a> helped the most!</p>

			<p>To replicate this to a real world scenario as close as possible, I had the following features implemented:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Automatically obtain the local IP address being used</li>
				<li>Scan again when the scan is over</li>
				<li>Check the differences between the old and new scan results</li>
				<li>Timestamp the scan results</li>
				<li>Document results to a log file when a port is opened or closed</li>
				<li>Overwrite new results into older file</li>
				<li>Spin up a new thread for each host</li>
			</ul>
