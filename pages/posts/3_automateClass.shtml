			<p>This post is about code I wrote to automate the duties of someone running a competition so my partner and I <s>don't have to come to class anymore</s>
			can invest more time in other projects. Do more with less, right?!</p>
			<p>This attack/defend class is structured to be divided into 3 rotating teams: 
			<font color="blue">blue</font> team, <font color="red">red</font> team, and <font color="white">white</font> team.
			White <font color="white">deploys</font>, red <font color="red">attacks</font>, and blue <font color="blue">defends</font>
			their respective virtual machines. 
			There is a fourth role, the back-end/DevOps guy.</p>

			<p class="subtopic">Infrastructure in place<p>
			<hr class="subtopicDecor">
			<p>The <b>physical topology</b> below has 36 computers (for the students) and each bench
			has 2 computers with have its own VLAN when connected to the core switch.
			There is quite a distance between the computers and the switch so there
			are wires running across the room with patch panels in between.</p>
			<figure>

			</figure>
			<p>The <b>logical topology</b> below shows the servers supporting it.
			<ul>
				<li>Windows 2012 Server - NAS as a iSCSI target so if the virtual
				infrastructure is down, storage server still works so virtual
				machines are accessible</li>
				<li>vCenter Server - GUI for all the VMs on the NAS, be it web
				browser or desktop application. Runs on Linux</li>
				<li>ESXi - hosts all the virtual machines for the competition</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>One major concern I had with the topology laid out was the lack
			of 10 gigabit ethernet connection to the ESXi server hosting the VMs
			from other computers. This made processing the machines very slow
			during crunch time and required students to show up early and wait
			for the Virtual Machines to finish loading for sandboxing.</p>

			<hr class="subtopicDecor">
			
			<p>The script accomplishes the following:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Request snapshot information</li>
				<li>Grant access to students</li>
				<li>Turn on virtual boxes</li>
				<li>Wait ~2 hours</li>
				<li>Message users before time limit</li>
				<li>Disconnect students</li>
				<li>Take away permissions</li>
				<li>Suspend virtual boxes</li>
				<li>Take snapshots</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="subtopic">Snapshot Prompts & Access Granted</p>
			<hr class="subtopicDecor">
			
			<p>Prompt user for snapshot folder names and descriptions for letting the code handle all the snapshots at the end.
			Beats having to wait 30 minutes to 1 hour after class to type some more commands! (since building full snapshots would happen one at a time).</p>

			<p>Grant access to all Red & Blue Team members via Console Only roles (done by adjusting privileges). In PowerCLI,
			permissions consist of roles, and roles consist of privileges so the hierarchy goes Permissions->Roles->Privileges.</p>

			<p>I figured printing out the virtual machines with their respective team colors would be neater than a constant black/white terminal.</p>

			<p class="subtopic">Starting Virtual Boxes Approach</p>
			<hr class="subtopicDecor">
			
			<p>Turn on blue and red team virtual machines consecutively (that users haven't already turned on).
			Sometimes people will be impatient and start the boxes anyways, so I take that into account in my code.</p>
			
			<p>Timing was a problem - white team and I usually come in early to make sure the infrastructure is ready
			for the competition. We would have to come in even earlier because the server could not handle processing 
			so many requests for so many virtual machines in a timely manner (hence the x1GB ethernet connection).</p>
			
			<p>If the code sent multiple requests to the server about turning on the virtual machines, the queue
			would take <i>significantly longer</i> to process, or even <i>expire</i> so the query never goes through.
			Consequently, I had to modify all phases of the code to issue each command to run in a linear fashion.</p>

			<p class="subtopic">Powershell Progress Bar</p>
			<hr class="subtopicDecor">
			
			<p>Instead of waiting for the competition to be over, I included a progress bar to show how much time has 
			passed with the <code>Write-Progress</code> cmdlet. Because of hiccups in the lab environment such as
			DNS going down or white team having delays, I would change the timer accordingly.</p>

			<p class="subtopic">Broadcast Message</p>
			<hr class="subtopicDecor">
			
			<p>White team always had to yell, "TEN MINUTES LEFT!" then 5 minutes later, "FIVE MINUTES LEFT!" towards the end of the class.
			I always wanted to figure out a way to get the message across by saving a few strains on their vocal chords.</p>
			<p>When I found out about this Broadcast Message of the Day [MoTD] feature, I was ecstatic. I had to be careful to not abuse this,
			since it sends a broadcast message to all users and they are forced to click on "OK" to continue.</p>
			<p>There were two ways to access the virtual machines in the competition: <u>VMware vSphere client</u> on desktop and
			<u>Web GUI</u> (Firefox is less of a hassle).
			The feature does not exist on a web browser, and there are future plans for the next back-end guy to push accessibility
			primarily to the cloud, so the broadcast messages were fun while they lasted.</p>
			<p>For giggles, I would let white team define the message:
				<ul>
					<li>5 minutes left lol</li>
					<li>Make like an autobot and ROLLOUT</li>
					<li>time to panic</li>
					<li>it's hiiiiiigh noon</li>
				</ul>

			<p class="subtopic">Killing Sessions & Suspending VMs</p>
			<hr class="subtopicDecor">
			
			<p>My professor wanted to know if I could terminate session keys of all students, thereby kicking them off the virtual environment.
			I wanted to know if it could be done.</p>
			<p>I came across session manager which allows me to forcibly remove the student's connection to the server and pull up other pieces of information
			such as username, key, full name, IP address, login time, and last active time.</p>
			<p>Second to last stage is to suspend all red and blue team boxes that haven't reached Suspend state.
			There was a few moments when the student still has access to the virtual machine, so I needed to kick
			them out of my infrastructure to actually ensure the new permissions go into effect.</p>
			<p>By grabbing the students' session key, I could terminate it.</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src="../../assets/images/3_automateclass/comp7_terminateSessions.png" alt="comp7_terminateSessions.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>Last task is to take snapshots of all virtual machines in the competition with predefined user input from the beginning.
			Finally, to suspend the machines without any issues. They are done sequentially so the script runs until the last
			query is done.</p>
			
			<p>I check back the next day to see if anything went wrong and ensure the virtual machines are ready for next week's competition.</p>
