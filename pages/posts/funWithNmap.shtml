			<p>After giving some thought about Nmap, I was thinking of a solid example for a real-word situation an Nmap script is required?
			A <b>perpetual scan</b>. This is usually done with a core server to carry out all the scans on the network for network audits.</p>
			
			<p>Testing environment includes:
				</p><ul>
					<li>Kali Linux v2.0.0 virtual box</li>
					<li>Full-duplex network connections</li>
					<li>Bash v4.3.30</li>
				</ul>
			<p></p>

			<p>Traditionally, Nmap is used as an offensive tool but the network mapper can also be used as a defensive tool. 
			You can constantly scan your local subnet instead. 
			The code uses Nmap and Ndiff to constantly scan the machine it's running on and reveal if there are any recent changes made in ports. 
			If you're being patient for a port to be active, then the results will turn up immediately!

			<p>I am a back-end guy for a blue/red/white team class. 
			For fun, I figured I'd go the extra mile and imagine being a blue/red team member. 
			I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/acomputerguy/Side-Projects/blob/master/Red-Blue-Team/perpetualScan.sh">active scanning script</a> in bash for the blue team to use so they'll know what's up when an attacker is temporarily using the service or red team can use it to find out at a given moment when a new port is being used. 
			The arguments I used are a service scan, printing out to an xml file (for ndiff, far more efficient than diff in this case), and rapidly sending packets. 
			The pros are that you'll know as soon as possible when a port is open (if you don't get your IP blocked first) and con is you're stirring up quite a packet storm. 
			???constantly change IP address??? I would imagine a centralized server is conducting the scans to its networks. 
			The goal was to replicate a real world scenario of a perpetual Nmap scan.</p>

			<p>I handed out the script to the two teams with some advice and in return wanted to know how they modified it for the competition. 
			The blue/red team is free to modify the code to their preferences, such as implementing a form of reactive security (i.e. close port when opened), changing parameters on the information they want (which will take extra time to scan), adjust the speed of nmap, automatically find the time duration between a port being opened and closed, and so on. 
			Red team will need to look into spoofing the IP &amp; MAC address with various addresses per packet.</p>

			<p>What I hope red team will achieve:
			</p><ul>
				<li>(-sT) Not to use TCP connect scans - will leave audible trail in logs</li>
				<li>(-sP) Not to do a ping sweep - way too many ICMP echo requests at once, obvious it's a new conversation each time</li>
				<li>(-sR) Not to do an RPC scan - it will "grind" out many packets since it opens lots of application sessions via rpc</li>
				<li>(-n) Reverse DNS is turned on by default - will add to hosts file, port 53 will snitch on you</li>
			</ul>

			</p><p>Not gonna lie here, I googled a few things to debug my code and figure out my approach. 
			Only major issue<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13799789/expansion-of-variable-inside-single-quotes-in-a-command-in-bash-shell-script"><sup>1</sup></a> was
			understanding the syntax when I had to use double quotes to pull out the contents in a variable that was inside single
			quotes from awk, which was inside back tic quotes to be run. Was a little bit of a <i>"whaaa?"</i> here. 
			A couple other<a href="http://superuser.com/questions/146174/nmap-easily-ping-scan-all-addresses-in-my-subnet"><sup>2</sup></a> links<a href="https://www.professormesser.com/nmap/how-to-supercharge-your-nmap-scans/4/"><sup>3</sup></a> were 
			useful in understanding my approach. 
			</p>

			<p>And to start, I run it in the background since it'll go on forever.</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src="../../assets/images/nmap_background.png" alt="nmap background.png">
			</figure>

			<p>As for my testing, I just kept starting and stopping the ssh service to test if my code works.
			Here you can see the ssh service seems to be off.</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src="../../assets/images/nmap_statusOff.png" alt="nmap status off.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>Time to turn the ssh service on and verify it's running.</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src="../../assets/images/nmap_statusOn.png" alt="nmap status on.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>The changes are reflected as results are parsed through to store the essentials in a log file.</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src="../../assets/images/nmap_reportLog.png" alt="nmap report log.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>In the beginning I had an inefficient approach to comparing the files.
			I constantly deleted them as I made new ones when I could've just recycled the same 2 files.</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src="../../assets/images/nmap_delete1.png" alt="nmap delete 1">
			</figure><p>As a result I had to constantly delete the contents of the recycle bin, but 
			now the poor code is gone.</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src="../../assets/images/nmap_delete2.png" alt="nmap delete 2.png">
			</figure>

			<p><b>Time</b> is another crucial factor to take into account. Here I have laid out a specific scenario:</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src="../../assets/images/nmap_visioExample.png" alt="nmap visio example.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>What if you're scanning a large subnet and the time the scan takes to go from the first host to the second to 
			last host is enough time for an attacker to get into the <i>last box</i>, use a service, then terminate the process, and close the port? 
			At that point in time Nmap won't be able to reveal any changes in the last host. 
			There can be logs of his activity but he/she can wipe this out too. 
			If I have 5 (simplified for brevity) machines that need to be scanned and the standard time it takes for 
			Nmap to complete a scan from box #1 to #4 is the same or less amount of time an attacker requires to enter 
			box #5 and open a port, do its thing, then close the port. 
			This way Nmap will never show the scan results because the scans are incremental unless specified otherwise.</p>
			
			<p>This is solved with concurrent packet requests - Nmap has a built-in feature to scan much faster by running in parallel. 
			Using the -T# (3-5) argument allows me to run scans in parallel by zipping out packets simultaneously for each scan so the time lapse issue won't occur. 
			If this approach is used, the only time frame given for an attacker is the instance the scan starts and finishes scanning the local box, which can be ridiculously fast.</p>

			<p><a href="https://nmap.org/book/man-performance.html">Nmap official documentation</a> helped the most!</p>

			<p>To replicate this to a real world scenario as close as possible, I had the following features implemented:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Automatically obtain the IP address being used</li>
				<li>Scan again when the scan is over</li>
				<li>Check the differences between the old and new scan results</li>
				<li>Timestamp the scan results</li>
				<li>Document results to a log file when a port is opened or closed</li>
				<li>Overwrite new results into older file</li>
				<li>Spin up a new thread for each host</li>
			</ul>
