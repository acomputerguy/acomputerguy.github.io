			<p>When we all started growing up, our parents would often remind us to not talk to strangers, hence the term, stranger danger 
			And now we <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=online+co-op+video+game">literally talk</a> to
			<a href="https://www.craigslist.org/">strangers</a> on a regular basis, 
			sometimes to even <a href="https://www.uber.com/">get home</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I'll be discussing how to take precautions in regards to social engineering
			with people from the internet from a <i>technical standpoint</i>.
			From a technical standpoint, this includes inspecting URLs in email, WhoIs lookups,
			reverse	engineering images, and metadata of images.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			When I was apartment hunting, some postings I read and emails I recieved was obviously a scam.
			At this point, I like to play a game I call 'How many red flags can I find?' in a single email.

			<p class="subtopic">Inspecting the email</p>
			<hr class="subtopicDecor">
			<p>In Gmail I click on the vertical ellipses button as shown below 
			and click on <i>Show original</i> to dissect the email.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="longBlogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/social_eng_show_original.png" alt="social_eng_show_original.png">
			</figure>
			<p>For example, in this email I wrote to myself:</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/social_eng_show_original_email1.png" alt="social_eng_show_original_email1.png">
			</figure>
			<p>Is really this in disguise:</p>

				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/social_eng_show_original_email2.png" alt="social_eng_show_original_email2.png">
			</figure>
			<p>
			If the URL is different than what is in the email, the sender loses all credibility right away. But if it's a strange-looking URL and
			the hidden URL is the same, run a check online to for potentially malicious links such as <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url">VirusTotal</a>.
			</p>
		
			<p class="subtopic">WHOIS lookup on senders' email domain</p>
			<hr class="subtopicDecor">
			
			<p>
			I can obtain some critical information from a <i>whois</i>
			lookup such as domain history, when the domain was purchased, and find out the contact to reach out to.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/social_eng_email_whois.png" alt="social_eng_email_whois.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>For starters, on the craigslist post I see posts for renting an apartment following a template. In these posts the provided contact information are:</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/craigslist_scammer_contact_1.png" alt="craigslist_scammer_contact_1.png">
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/craigslist_scammer_contact_2.png" alt="craigslist_scammer_contact_2.png">
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/craigslist_scammer_contact_3.png" alt="craigslist_scammer_contact_3.png">
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/craigslist_scammer_contact_4.png" alt="craigslist_scammer_contact_4.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>The following domains are brought into question: <font color="red">ioptius</font>, <font color="red">ulivetez</font>, 
			<font color="red">ebudot</font>, and <font color="red">wzedok</font>. The example we will look at is for wzedok.com.</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/social_eng_whois_Lookup_1of2.png" alt="social_eng_whois_Lookup_1of2.png">
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/social_eng_whois_Lookup_2of2.png" alt="social_eng_whois_Lookup_1of2.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>From this WhoIs lookup we can see</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creation date</li>
				<li>Domain Registratr</li>
				<li>Registrant/Admin/Tech Contact Information</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>A lot of the information is redacted or sent elsewhere (@contactprivacy.email) for privacy reasons to avoid automatic emails from bots asking about their domain or website.
			Google Domains can obscure certain bits of information for you.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/social_eng_privacy_protection.png" alt="social_eng_privacy_protection.png">
			</figure>		

			<p>When the contact information is blank, that usually raises a red flag because there is no way to reach out to someone for questions and proves
			the absolute minimal setup was done in providing information for the domain or does not want to be reached out to. But here, the contact information
			is obscured, which isn't a crime...Let's see what else I can find out.</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/social_eng_cr_dates_post.png" alt="social_eng_cr_dates_post.png">
			</figure>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/social_eng_whois_dates.png" alt="social_eng_whois_dates.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>The dates line up so the same day the domain was made, the Craigslist post was created. Now if I could only verify that the domain's only use
			is just for craigslist, I can't quite cross it off as a scammer just yet...</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/social_eng_search_domain.png" alt="social_eng_search_domain.png">
			</figure>
			<p>By encapsulating the domain name in quotes I can have Google find all other uses for the domain name. I see it's only used for rental apartments
			on Craigslist and nothing else, which is enough of a confirmation it's a scammer to me.</p>

			<p>Another common scenario is having domain names that sound close to pre-existing organizations. I was reached out by someone on AirBnB
			whose domain name was interesting.</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/social_eng_email_SaundersTech.png" alt="social_eng_email_SaundersTech.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>I looked up "saunders tech nyc" and came across a similar naming convention as a public high school in the area. They use a different 
			domain name of yonkerspublicschools, not saunders-tech!</p>

				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/social_eng_google_images.png" alt="social_eng_google_images.png">
			</figure>	
			
			<p>If you see a post looking too good to be true, odds are it's too good to be true. For example, here is a Craigslist scam posting:</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/social_eng_google_images_cr_post.png" alt="social_eng_google_images_cr_post.png">
			</figure>
			<p>A quick Google Images search will show me this originated from Centreport Lake Luxury Apartments. Or maybe the landlord fell in love 
			with the room layout from another state so much, he/she had to model his unit identical to the other apartment...Yeah it's fake.</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/social_eng_google_images_cr_post_2.png" alt="social_eng_google_images_cr_post_2.png">
			</figure>

			<p class="subtopic">File metadata</p>
			<hr class="subtopicDecor">
			
			<p>If someone has reached out to you and "personally" provided pictures for credibility, then you can take a look at the metadata to see if
			the files are as credible as the owner claims (such as comparing a pictures coordinates to where the owner says the photo is).</p>
			<p>Using a picture I took as an example:</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="longBlogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/Duck_On_Grass.jpg" alt="Duck_On_Grass.jpg">
			</figure>
			<p>GPS tagging is enabled on my phone so the image has coordinates on it.</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="longBlogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/Duck_On_Grass_Properties.png" alt="Duck_On_Grass.png">
			</figure>
			<p>Note the missing units associated with these numbers. Using the information provided, Google Maps will tell me where this location is.</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/5_socialeng/Duck_On_Grass_GoogleMaps.png" alt="Duck_On_Grass.png">
			</figure>
			<p>And that's where the duck was! If another medium was used (Craigslist, Imgur, etc) odds are the metadata has been stripped so there can be no
			tracing back, but these are all things everyone should know regardless.</p>
