			</aside>
		
			<p>On the first day of work, I like to configure my web browser and email to get 
			more work done efficiently. Keyword bookmarks, email filtering, and web browser
			 shortcuts will be discussed. </p>
			<p class="subtopic">Keyword Bookmarks in Web Browser</p>
				<p>I usually prefer Chrome, but the guide will be on Firefox.
				For the company intranet, I go through this process -</p>
			<p>Example: wikipedia</p>
			<p>>Right-click on the search bar in Wikipedia</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/pic1_wiki.png" alt="pic1_wiki.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>>Select <i>Add a keyword for this search...</i></p>
			
			<p>>In the Keyword bar, I typed <i>wiki</i></p>
				<figure>
					<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/pic2_wiki.png" alt="pic2_wiki.png">
				</figure>
				<p>>In address bar, type in <i>wiki &lt;topic&gt;</i> and hit enter!</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/pic3_wiki.png" alt="pic3_wiki.png">
			</figure>
				<p>Sometimes, this doesn't work for every website. The web browser doesn't properly format the query to their database, so there is a more manual set of steps to follow:</p>
			<p>>Pull up the search engine results with a random string of characters (not a page)</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/pic4_wiki_missing.png" alt="pic4_wiki_missing.png">
			</figure>
			<p>>Copy the URL</p>
			<p>>Click on <i>Show your bookmarks</i> icon in the top right <img class="blogPic" src = "../assets/images/pic5_manual.png" alt="pic5_manual.png"></p>
			<p>>Click on <i>Show all bookmarks</i></p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/pic6_manual.png" alt="pic6_manual.png">
			</figure>
				<p>>Right-click on <i>Bookmarks Toolbar</i></p>
			<p>>From the drop-down, click on <i>New Bookmark...</i></p>
			<p>>Fill out the information as you see fit and paste the URL in the Location section</p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/pic7_manual.png" alt="pic7_manual.png">
			</figure>
				<p>>Replace the random string of characters from before with %s and hit <i>Add</i></p>
				<p>The %s means the argument is taken in as a string after the keyword in the URL, then submitted as part of the query to pull up results from their database.</p>
				<p>Why use bookmark shortcuts, wait for the page to load, then type in the search engine when you can do all 3 at once from the address bar?
				Doing so saves me about 10 seconds. While in the short-term, seconds may seem like nothing but in the long run, this technique helps me save minutes, even hours. 
				As a frequent computer user, I find this to be highly useful. 
				This is another step closer to being the computer guy who only uses the keyboard to navigate through a computer!</p>

				<p class="subtopic">Email filtering</p>
				<p>I've noticed either Microsoft Outlook or Gmail is preferred, but I'll be talking about gmail here because I wrote a script to assist with filters.
				Usually once you start the job, you're bombarded with emails so during first week's downtime, I like to filter certain categories into certain folders.
				For filtering emails such as various project topics or miscellaneous (news, events), I go through this process.</p>
				<p>>Click on the arrow on the right side of the search bar</p>
			<p>>Filter with given properties; <i>From, To, Subject, Has the words, Doesn't have</i></p>
			<p>>For my example, I chose <i>From my email address</i> and <i>To my email address</i>, <i>subject test subject</i>, and has the words <i>this is a test</i>. This is for test cases when I send myself email. When finished, click on <em>Create filter with this search</em> >></p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/email1.png" alt="email1.png">
			</figure>
				<p>>Click on <i>Apply the label</i> check box and from the drop-down options and click on <i>New Label</i></p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/email2.png" alt="email2.png">
			</figure>
				<p>>For my example, I typed <i>test label</i>. Click on <i>Create</i></p>
			<figure>
				<img class="blogPic" src = "../../assets/images/email3.png" alt="email3.png">
			</figure>
			<p>>Go back to the Inbox</p>
			<p>>Type in the search bar, label:<i>&lt;name of label&gt;</i>, where the name of my label is <i>label test</i></p>
				<p>>In the toolbar at the top, click on the checkbox</p>
			<p>>Click on the archive button</p>
				<p>I don't want to show only archived mail then click the archive button every single time when this can be automated with a script.
			<p>Instead of having to continuously archive in the last 4 steps, I created a <a href="https://github.com/acomputerguy/Side-Projects/blob/master/Google-Apps-Script/multipleInboxes.js">script</a> using Google Apps Script, which is in JavaScript with Google's own suite of libraries.</p>
				<p>My approach to Google Apps Script:</p>
			<p>You can use a built-in feature to create multiple inboxes, but they exist with extra panes taking up part of the screen.</p>
			<p>Shout out to HubSpot for making a <a href = "https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-set-up-gmail-filters#sm.00010ip997xyrf72q282kljgy1p7t">simple guide!</a></p>
			<p>I don't want any extra space taken up on the screen, I would rather be able to click on the inbox and show the messages specific to a given category.</p>
				<p>Gmail doesn't have a way to create multiple inboxes that do not show up on a pane. I want to avoid taking up space on the screen so my script will have similar properties as gmail "inbox", which is done through labeling and archiving in the background instead of foreground. I could add some code for automatic labeling, but why reinvent the wheel?</p>
				Having no background in JavaScript, programming a script to accomplish this task was an enjoyable experience.
				<p>Thanks to Google Apps Script for their <a href = "https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/gmail/">beautiful documentation and query examples!</a></p>

				</figure>
				<p>>Open Google Apps Script</p>
				<p>>Copy and paste the code 
				<p>I tried many different approaches my idea. The constant debugging and searching for methods relevant to my interests led me to a more efficient way to do my code each time.
				<p>Some issues I ran into:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Looping through email threading hits a cap - the maximum a user can input in the code is 500.</li>
				<li>Being able to refresh the page via google apps script is a WIP, you will have to wait for the page to refresh itself or click on inbox</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="subtopic">Web browser shortcuts</p>
			<p>I like to navigate without my mouse. The more proficient I am with keyboard shortcuts,
			the less I'll need to use the mouse</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ctrl + L</li>
				<li>Ctrl + Tab</li>
				<li>Ctrl + #</li>
				<li>Alt + Tab</li>
				<li>Alt + Left or Right Arrow</li>
				<li>Windows Key + Keyword</li>
			</ul>
