		<h2>The Internet and World Wide Web</h2>

		<h3>Internet (1969)</h3>
		
		<div class="section">
			<p>The <code>Internet</code> is the "worldwide network of interconnected computers and related equipment."
			In other words, acts as the foundation for a plethora of online applications.
			Some of these common applications include:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li class="spacing">Email (1971) [<strong>E</strong>lectronic <strong>mail</strong>]<br>
				This application is <em>a system of sending electronic mail to accounts on remote machines</em>.</li>

				<li class="spacing">Telnet (1972) [<strong>Tel</strong>etype <strong>Net</strong>work]<br>
				The protocol is <em>a tool to let you log in to remote computers</em>.</li>

				<li class="spacing">FTP (1973) [<strong>F</strong>ile <strong>T</strong>ransfer <strong>P</strong>rotocol]<br>
				The aforementioned protocol can <em>moves files from one computer to another</em>.</li>

				<li class="spacing">Gopher (1991) [Protocol for browsing the web]<br>
				This epochal application is the <em>first menu-driven Internet application used to
				share documents</em>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h3>World Wide Web (1991)</h3>
		
		<div class="section">
			<p>The <code>World Wide Web</code> is a "system of interlinked hypertext documents connected
			by the Internet". In short, interconnected web pages with the Internet supporting
			it. The concept was proposed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. Only 2 years later was
			the Internet available and popularity skyrocket another 2 years after.</p>

			<p>The WWW was originally intended to share structured (research) documents between
			scientists with markups such as paragraphs, headings, lists, and figures with captions.
			This was done using a web language; HTML (<strong>H</strong>yper<strong>t</strong>ext 
			<strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage). Without this,
			text would appear as long strings on a web page with no easy readability. For example,
			a 05151990 can be a birthdate but can more understood more closely with markups by
			05/15/1990. Or even sections of text being organized such as chapter or topic with
			headers, paragraph and indentation.</p>

			<ul>
				<li class="spacing">Browser<br>
				Popular names of web browsers in this day and age are: Safari, Chrome, 
				Firefox, Internt Explorer, and Opera. In its basic form, it is an application
				used to procure, present, and transfer information. Some statistics about modern
				day web is taht 65% of the information on a web page is images and photos (bytes,
				size wise) and 35 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube daily.<a href ="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> 
				Some basic terminology is latency (time it takes to send a packet) and bandwidth
				(maximum throughput of a logical/physical medium).<a href ="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></li>

				<li class="spacing">Lynx<br>
				Lynx is the text web browser. It was designed to show a simple and fast way to 
				get a new product online. As of now, it has an innovative way to talk
				over the Internet such as turning on an oven from work.<a href ="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> With its 
				highly customizable features, it is the oldest web browser in use.<a href ="#4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></li>

				<li class="spacing">Mosaic<br>
				The first GUI browser developed by Mard Andreesen. As of now, it is currently
				discontinued but its services and mark in Internet history helped shaped the WWW. 
				The Mosiac had revolutionaized the way web browsers acted by "added graphics...
				ported software from so-called Unix computers."<a href ="#5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> However, by 1998 the web browser
				was replaced by others.</li>

				<li class="spacing">Hypertext<br>
				Hypertext is text that contains links to other text. Another similar term,
				hypermedia is hypertext containing links to graphics, video and sound.
				Both terms were coined by Ted Nelson in 1963.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Difference between Internet and WWW</p>
			<p>The Internet is the back-end, where servers are running services. The WWW
			is the front-end, where web sites are often displayed with interactive behavior
			between the site and the user.</p>
